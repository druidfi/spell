# druidfi/spell

This is a composer create-project repository which will create Druid's Drupal 8 project on top of our template `druidfi/d8-template`.

After the installation you'll have a directory with our template which is setup with git hooks and various tools to handle your Drupal 8 codebase.

## Requirements

- PHP and Composer
- Read access to druifi/d8-template repository

## How to use?

```
$ composer create-project druidfi/spell:dev-master <project-path>
```

## Next steps

Git has been init in the directory `<project-path>` but you need to specify your remote before you can push.

More documentation on the template can be found at the [druidfi/d8-template](https://github.com/druidfi/d8-template) repository.
